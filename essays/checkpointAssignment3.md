## Develop a prototype of your entire application that addresses the following points:

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/nVgvyNnZqsw">Checkpoint Assignment 3 on Youtube</a></p>

<p><b>Show what each page will look like</b></p>
<p>Shown in the video</p>

<p><b>Describe your design for your siteâ€™s shopping cart</b></p>
<p>Shown in the video</p>

<p><b>Explain specifically how you will use sessions to manage your shopping cart</b></p>
<p>I am still unsure about how I will do this. But the general idea is that the shopping cart info is stored in the sessions table. Manipulating the session.cart data will manage the shopping cart. This should be possible on the cart page.</p>

<p><b>How will you avoid access to your application when the user has not logged in or registered?</b></p>
<p>The way I am thinking about is to have the session contain some kind of information only given by the server than lets the invoice page know not to load without that said information.</p>

<p><b>Upon a successful login, how do you provide personalization in your UI?</b></p>
<p>Yes. I would like to put some personalization in the navbar or at the bottom of the screen. I haven't yet implemented it.</p>

<p><b>If you are working with partners, how will you split up the work in your team so that you are working in parallel as effectively as possible?</b></p>
<p>I am not working with partners</p>

<p><b>How are you approaching Assignment 3 differently than Assignment 2?</b></p>
<p>Planning! I planned out my site layout and the details of how the pages interact with each other in advance rather than figuring it out as I go along.</p>
