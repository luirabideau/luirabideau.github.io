<p><b>Starting Out</b></p>
<p>I began the first Browser History WOD project feeling very excited. After reading the instructions and the athletic approach reading, I got the feeling that a lot of thought had gone into developing this course and I was excited to experience it. </p>
<p>Prior to starting, I read and took notes on required readings, making sure to thoroughly understand the relationships between CSS and HTML. In previous coding classes, I had learned the importance of linking files together and allowing them to communicate with each other. This really saved me in the Browser History WODs. </p>

<p><b>Browser Histroy 1</b></p> 
<p>Browser History 1 was fairly easy, I think I finished it within the time, but I was not satisfied with my time. I wasted a lot of time struggling to write out all the information. I did it a few more times, focusing as much as I could on my narration and usage of time. On the third attempt I did manage to get the time of Rx. </p>

<p><b>Browser Histroy 2</b></p> 
<p>Browser History 2 was more enjoyable for me because it was more challenging. Not incredibly challenging, but pleasantly challenging. I enjoyed using the information I had studied and taken notes about. I redid it three times to get the Rx score. During this project, I think I learned the most, especially about servers and server updating.</p>

<p><b>Browser History 3</b></p> 
<p>Browser History 3 was surprisingly difficult. My first attempt was sad– I could not figure out how to make the navigation bar. So after the time ran out, I watched the video and did my best to understand what was going on. I did learn a lot about margins, classes, IDs, and other HTML and CSS syntax. I looked up many things independently just so I could  be sure I understood them. I redid it a second time and managed to get the Rx score. </p>

<p><b>General Thoughts</b></p> 
<p>My advice is simple– start early! There is already a lot of pressure filming and narrating, you don’t need the pressure of feeling behind. Do the readings, take notes on the readings. Don’t be afraid to google, don’t be afraid to test out things– there’s an undo button! I did delete my code every time I redid it. I was never tempted to keep the files, because I reason that I should always be able to redo my work. </p>
