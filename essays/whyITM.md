<p><b>Starting in Mechanical Engineering </b></p> 
I started my college journey as a Mechanical Engineering major. A career that would challenge me to think critically and allow me to come up with creative solutions to real life problems was my goal. I found that engineering was not what I was expecting. Engineering taught me many technical skills like programming, computer hardware, advanced math, and physics but it lacked emphasis on business applications.

<p><b>Discovering ITM</b></p>
I finished my engineering journey with an Associateâ€™s degree and began to look at other majors. After explaining to my counselor that I had enjoyed the computer programming and critical thinking aspects of engineering, she recommended that I look into ITM. Having never heard of it before, I was shocked to find that there was a major that focused on problem solving for businesses using IT technology. Immediately, it seemed like an excellent fit for me.

<p><b>Transfer into Shidler</b></p> 
Coming into the Shidler college and the ITM program, I feel like I have found my calling. It is exciting to hear about the career options of my major, and what problems I may face in the IT industry. I like my professors, peers, and the material I am studying. I am confident that my outlook on ITM will continue for the rest of the semester and far into my career.
