<h5>1. Briefly describe your system (e.g. A store selling Pokemon game cards)</h5>
<p>My website is a website that sells mini-skyscraper figurines.</p>
<h5>2. Any notable shortcomings, bugs, problems, or additional features not implemented?</h5>
<p>The security really isn't that good. I simply don't know enough about web security to add too much without fully copying material from somewhere.</p>
<h5>3. Describe what you are most proud of about your system:</h5>
<p>I am most proud of the navbar. I am sure that absolutely everyone else would have done just as good if not as well as I have done. But the navbar is my favorite because I made the whole thing in one sitting, I didn’t make mistakes– I just did it.</p>
<h5>4. Describe what you are least happy with your system:</h5>
<p>Security. Security is by far the weakest link. And it’s mainly because I simply don’t understand enough about website security to do anything about it. Many of the pages shouldn’t be accessible at all, however, they can be accessed (although nothing will show on them).</p>
<h5>5. How was developing this assignment different than assignment #2?</h5>
<p>Planning and generalization was at the heart of this assignment. Assignment 2 was incredibly complicated and hard coded with query strings. In comparison, Assignment 3 is significantly more general and modularized, which required significantly more planning.</p>
<h5>6. When you ran into a problem, what did you do to address it?</h5>
<p>Debugger, console.log(), and chatGPT. Depending on where or what the issue is.</p>
<h5>7. Describe what worked well in doing this assignment?</h5>
<p>Talking it through. Whether I talked with the professor, my classmates, ChatGPT, or myself, talking was so helpful. Being forced to use the correct terms and know exactly what I’m asking for, really helped me get the answers I needed or get me in the right direction.</p>
<h5>8. Describe what did not work well in doing this assignment?</h5>
<p>Trying to save portions of code from Assignment 2 that I worked hard on. Assignment 3 is a whole new assignment and the sooner I let go of Assignment 2 code and just deleted everything that made things more complicated, it started to get much easier.</p>
<h5>9. What did you learn from doing this assignment?</h5>
<p>I learned how important planning and project management is. It is so important to understand exactly what you are trying to do and to create a comprehensive plan to achieve that. Additionally, I learned a lot about the inner workings and structure of browsers and websites.
</p>
<h5>10. If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you change?</h5>
<p>I would be incredibly uptight about my naming and commenting. There was not a lot of incentive to label things well in Assignment 1, and slightly more incentive in Assignment 2. However, Assignment 3 is just so complicated that it is imperative to have good labeling and commenting habits.</p>
<h5>11. Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging</h5>
<p><b>(a): 65%</b> -  figuring out clever solutions to achieve all objectives/solve any issues was the main way I spend my time. I would be thinking about it all day– in the shower, eating, when I woke up I’d be like “could I send that information via~”.</p>
<p><b>(b): 5%</b>   -  actually writing code is such a small portion of this project, most of the code is already written, it’s all about how to access information you want.</p>
<p><b>(c): 30%</b> -  testing and debugging is a significant part of the project, but with the debugger, I spend much less time debugging.</p>
<h5>12. Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself) and explain briefly your rationale for the percentage breakdown. Be sure to include an overview of what specifically you and your partners contributed (e.g. “I worked on the security and my partner 1 worked on personalization”)</h5>
<p>100%, I worked alone. </p>
