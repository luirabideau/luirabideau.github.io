        <div style="font-weight: bold; font-size: x-large;">Bachelor of Business Administration in Management Information Systems</div>
          <p>University of Hawaii at Manoa - expected Fall 2025</p>
          <p><b>Degree Overview</b><br>The Management Information Systems (MIS) major teaches how to analyze opportunities for business change and growth using information technologies (IT), to design and develop business solutions that utilize IT, and to manage projects to implement IT-related change. Designing and managing information flows within and between firms and their customers is critical in today’s business enterprise. All firms in every type of industry – large or small, for-profit or not-for-profit – rely on information systems and technologies for ongoing operations and future growth. The Internet and other information technologies also create entrepreneurial opportunities for new or existing firms. (Many of today’s leading firms grew rapidly from IT innovation.)
          </p><p>
          The MIS major offers students the flexibility to focus course work on business analysis, project management, or technical design. MIS majors are prepared for careers in project management, business analysis, networking, system architecture and design, and technical support. MIS majors are prepared to work as in-house information systems staff, as consultants for information systems and accounting firms, as independent contractors, and as business entrepreneurs. The Bureau of Labor Statistics forecasts increasing job growth for MIS–related careers. <i style="font-size: small;">From the Shidler College of Business <a href="https://shidler.hawaii.edu/ms/information-systems">website</a></i></p>
